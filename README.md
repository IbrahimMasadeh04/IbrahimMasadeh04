### 🧑‍💻 Featured Projects

#### 🟢 [AceVision](https://github.com/IbrahimMasadeh04/AceVision)
A prototype, real-time tennis posture analysis system using **YOLO**, **pose estimation**, and **AR feedback overlays**.  
> Helps players improve performance through AI-based posture correction.

#### 🔤 [Morse Code Eye Blink Decoder](https://github.com/IbrahimMasadeh04/morse-code-decoder)
A **computer vision project** that decodes Morse Code based on **eye blinks** in real time.  
It uses **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** to detect blink durations, translating them into Morse characters.  
The system sends decoded messages to a **C# WinForms desktop app**, displaying them live on screen —  
making it a creative and accessible communication tool for users with limited mobility.  
> 💡 Combines Python for real-time blink detection and C# for GUI integration.

#### ✋ [Hand Controller](https://github.com/IbrahimMasadeh04/HandController)
A gesture-based control system that lets users **control their computer using hand movements**.  
With **MediaPipe**, **pyautogui**, and **pycaw**, the system recognizes gestures to move the mouse, click, and adjust volume.  
Supports **multi-hand input** — one hand for mouse control, the other for sound — all through a mirrored webcam feed for intuitive interaction.  
> 🖐️ Turns your webcam into a hands-free human–computer interface.
